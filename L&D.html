    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>500gr. ground meat</li>
      <li>2 medium onions</li>
      <li>4 tbsp ground stale bread/bread crumbs</li>
      <li>Handful of parsley (optional)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp each of salt, pepper, and paprika</li>
      <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ol>

      alt="food img"
    />
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a food proccessor cut the parsley and onion then add the beef and all
        of the seasoning. Make sure it doesn't become a paste and still has some
        chunks
      </li>
      <li>
        When forming the kofte you want to make your hands a bit wet so that it
        doens't stick to your hands. You want to form each kofte into a ball
        then press down to make it a disk. The meat will come together and
        shrink while cooking so take that into consideration when forming the
        kofte pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the kofte on a hot non-stick or castiron pan and apply olive oil to
        the top before adding the meat. The meat should form a crust if cooked
        correctly, and you want to take it off the pan when it has browned all
        around.
      </li>
      <li>Serve it with rice, vegetables, or yogurt.</li>

      alt="food img"
    />
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Dough: By combining flour, eggs, salt and water until everything holds
        together. Knead it for 5-10 minutes. It won't be a very soft dough. We
        make the dough with our hands, but you can use a food processor or a
        stand mixer if you want. Cover the dough ball with a damp kitchen towel
        and let it rest for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Filling: In a medium bowl, combine ground meat, finely chopped onions,
        parsley, salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rolling the Dough: with a rolling pin. It doesn't have to be very thin.
        You can use a pasta roller for this step if you have one. Make it about
        2mm or 1/16 inches. Using a sharp knife or a pizza cutter, cut it first
        into strips and then into small squares.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shapping Each Manti: Put a little filling on each square and close them
        up one by one to give each a bundle shape. How? As you see in the
        pictures below, first fold the tiny square into two and seal all the
        opposite corners of the dough in the center. Then you have this
        bundle-like shape. It takes us no longer than 20 minutes to finish them
        all!
      </li>
      <li>
        Cooking: Cook just like paste boiling water in a big pot and adding all
        the manti you have prepared. While the manti is cooking in a very small
        pan you add olive oil and chili flakes and cook until hot and almost
        boiling
      </li>
      <li>
        Sauces: While the manti is cooking in a very small pan you add olive oil
        and chili flakes and cook until hot and almost boiling mix and prepare
        the yogurt sauce by mixing the yogurt with finely diced garlic
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve: Serve the manti in a big bowl you can add pasta water to make it
        a watery or you can just add the manti itself its up to your own
        preference. To the manti you want to add the yogurt, and the chili oil,
        as well as the dried mint and sumac.
      </li>
