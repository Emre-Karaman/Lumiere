    <h3>instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Sift the flower than add the yeast and hot water</li>
      <li>mix till combined then add salt</li>
      <li>
        Gently mix with your fingers to form a dough, it will be sticky at that
        stage.
      </li>

      <li>
        Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and then knead it for
        4-5 minutes or until it doesn't stick to your hands anymore.
      </li>
      <li>
        in a bowl cover the dough with cling film and let it rest till it rises
        to double its current size
      </li>
      <li>In a large pan cook the ground beef on medium heat till brown</li>
      <li>
        Depending on the fat ration of your minced meat you can add the diced
        onions straight to the pan or add olive oil to pan first then add the
        onions and cook till translucent
      </li>
      <li>
        Add salt, pepper, and chili flake to your meat mix then take it off of
        the heat
      </li>
      <li>
        Now that your dough is rested and meat is ready split the dough to 4
        equal pieces
      </li>
      <li>
        roll out each piece to an oval shape making sure its not too thin so
        that it can hold the meat without breaking
      </li>
      <li>
        add 1/4th of your meat filling to each piece of dough leaving around
        1-2cm of space on the edge
      </li>
      <li>
        Then carefully close the filling by folding both sides into each other
        making sure to pinch the dough at the top leaving no holes
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 220 &#8451; - 430 &#8457;</li>
      <li>
        Once the oven is heated up put in your pide on a tray with baking paper
        and cook for around 15 minutes or until the outside is golden brown
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you have taken out the pide from the oven and brush the entire
        thing with butter
