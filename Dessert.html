      <li>Oil</li>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix the sugar and water in a small saucepan over high heat. Once it
        starts to boil, turn off the heat and set aside to let cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sifting the flour is important to minimize the chances of clumping. Sift
        a few times for best results. Heat the neutral oil (or melt the vegan
        butter) on a large, wide pan on low heat. Gradually add sifted flour
        while vigorously mixing with a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula. It
        will become smooth within a minute.

        Once the roux reaches the peanut-butter-colored stage, carefully pour
        the cooled syrup into the flour paste away from your face. Mix for about
        a minute, turn off the heat, cover pot with lid or cloth napkin, and let
        cool. This is the most fun stage of making halva! You can make it in any
        shape you prefer and serve with ice cream.

      alt="food img"
    />
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add your water and rice to a medium-sized saucepan. Bring the water to
        the boil and then simmer until the water has been absorbed and the rice
        is cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now add the milk, leaving a splash (around 30 mls) behind. Pour in the
        sugar and the double cream and stir together. Bring the mixture to the
        boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, add the remainder of your milk to your cornstarch and stir
        until the cornstarch is dissolved. Turn the heat down to medium and
        gradually pour in your cornstarch and milk mixture, stirring constantly.
        Continue to stir your sütlaç gently for around 15 minutes until the
        pudding is thick and creamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Share your sütlaç between 4 small, individual oven-proof bowls, dust the
        tops with a little cinnamon (if using) and allow to cool a little so
        that it sets on top. Preheat your grill and place your bowls of sütlaç
        under the heat until the top bubbles and darkens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow to cool and then place in the fridge for a couple of hours. Eat
        your sütlaç directly from the dish.

      alt=" food img"
    />
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put milk and sugar (and 1 tablespoon rosewater if you like) in a pot and
        heat it until the sugar melts. Stir it occasionally. It shouldn't be too
        hot to touch, so let it cool a little.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the layers in a pan. Put a gullac sheet in the pan. Wet it with the
        warm milk. Repeat this with five sheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the fifth one, spread the crumbled walnut on it. Then put the rest
        five sheets one by one and wet each of them with milk. When you finish
        with the tenth one, pour the rest of the milk on it. They don't need to
        be very good in shape while arranging them in the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        They will combine when they get wet with milk. After pouring the milk,
        you will see the sheets are rising, do not touch them. Cover it with
        stretch film and put it in refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Then serve
        and garnish with walnuts or pistachio and pomegranate
      </li>
